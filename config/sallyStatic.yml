# BabelCache configuration. Only uncomment those settings you actually need,
# otherwise non-available adapters might show up in the backend.
babelcache:
  _dummy: ~ # <- only here just so that 'babelcache' is always an object (otherwise overwriting it would yield an error)

  # Memcached support
  # each element in the list must be a tripel consisting of host, port and weight.
  # try to use IPs instead of hostnames

#  memcached:
#    - ['127.0.0.1', 11211, 1]
#    - ['42.42.42.42', 11211, 2]

  # Memcached with Authentication (SASL) support
  # if your Memcached daemon requires authentication, use this. Note that the
  # SASL cache uses only the FIRST server.

#  memcached_sasl: [username, password]

  # Redis
  # See https://github.com/nrk/predis#connecting-to-redis for more info on how
  # this config structure can look like.

#  redis:
#    host: '127.0.0.1'
#    port: 6379

  # MySQL support
  # Uncomment these if you want to be able to cache using a MySQL database.
  # This can very well be another server than the regular Sally database.

#  mysql:
#    host: localhost
#    user: username
#    password: mysupersecretpassword
#    database: mycachedb
#    table: mycache
